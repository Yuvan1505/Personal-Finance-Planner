# Personal-Finance-Planner

Many people especially students and young earners don’t track where their money goes. Traditional finance apps are complex, require logins, or only focus on recording data without offering personalized insights. Users need a smart, simple, offline-friendly, and visually interactive tool that helps them plan, predict, and improve their finances intelligently.

The app analyzes the user’s spending pattern using JavaScript logic (e.g., “You spent 40% on food this month — try reducing by 10% to save ₹500 more”).
